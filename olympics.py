# Question - 1:  Create a dataframe with with following data cleanup to make this file redable.
# - Skip first row
# - Rename column containing 01, 02 and 03 to Gold, Silver and Bronze
# - Split country name and country code and add country name as data frame index
# - Drop column Totals

# Question-2 : What is the first country in dataframe? Write a function to return first country detail.

# Question â€“ 3: Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

# Question - 4: Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

# Question - 5: Write a function to update the dataframe to include a new column called "Points" for Games which
# is a weighted value where each gold medal counts for 3 points, silver medals for 2 points, and bronze
# mdeals for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.
